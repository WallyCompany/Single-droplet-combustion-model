# Single-droplet-combustion-model
Matlab implementation of "Theoretical single droplet model for particle formation in flame spray pyrolysis" by Yihua Ren, Jinzhi Cai, Heinz Pitsch. Energy and Fuel. 2020.
# Result
The codes in the folder 'Multicomponent fuel' is for modeling single droplet with multicomponent fuel without precursor reactions.
The codes in the folder 'precursor' is for modeling single droplet with multicomponent fuel with precursor reactions.
The model and detailed results can be found in the above paper.
# Prerequisites
Matlab 2018b or later
